# SendtoDiscord
Simple Python script which sends a message to Discord via a GUI that pops up.

## Required Deps:
- Discord.py Async Branch (https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- PySimpleGUI (https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI)

## Info:
I made this because I got bored, really. I told iAmir I could make this in 5 minutes or less using Python whereas it'd probably take me longer using C# (which is true, I am only a newbie at C#). So yeah, here you go. Take it or leave it :shrug:.
